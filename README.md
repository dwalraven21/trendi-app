## Challenges

One of our biggest challenges was allowing users to click a state on the map to show only trends from that state.

```JavaScript
mapHandler = (event) => {

	let location = event.target.dataset.name
	console.log(location);
	fetch(`/api/posts/${location}`, {
		method: 'GET',
		headers: {
			'Accept': 'application/json, text/plain, */*',
			'Content-Type': 'application/json'
		}
	})
	.then(data => data.json())
	.then(jData => {
		this.setState({ posts: [jData] })

	})

};

```
Another challenge was allowing the users to update the rank of each item by upvoting or downvoting. Here is how we acomplished this. We created a function that takes for parameters the index of the item we are updating and the delta or difference we want the rank to change.
In setState we created two variables: updatedPosts, to contain our current array and updatedPost, to contain the item we want to update.
We can now add the delta to the current post's rank. To make sure this change persists and actually updates in the database, we called our hnadleUpdate function passing in the updatedPost.

```JavaScript
  handleRankChange = (index, delta) => {
	  this.setState( prevState => {
		  // new array - copy of previous posts array
		  const updatedPosts = [ ...prevState.posts ];
		  // a copy of the post we are targeting
		  const updatedPost = updatedPosts[index];

		  // Update the target post's rank
		  updatedPost.rank += delta;
		
		// Call the handleUpdate function and pass it the updated post. This ensures the data will be mutated.	
		  this.handleUpdate(updatedPost);
	  })
  }

```
Here's our handleUpdate function for reference.

```JavaScript
 handleUpdate = (updateData) => {
	  fetch(`/api/posts/${updateData.id}`, {
		  body: JSON.stringify(updateData),
		  method: 'PUT',
		  headers: {
			'Accept': 'application/json, text/plain, */*',
			'Content-Type': 'application/json'
		  }
	  })
	  .then(updatedPost => {
		// call this.fetchPosts to show the updated post immediately
		this.fetchPosts()
	  })
	  .catch(err => console.log(err))
  }
```
Here's where the function is being called. When the user clicks the up arrow the handleRankChange function is being passed the item index and the integer 1, when the user clicks the down arrow, it is passed -1, so the rank will decrease by 1.

We also added a ternary operator to change the class of the rank number if it was positive or negative.
```JavaScript
<ul className="vote">
	<li className="upvote" onClick={() => {this.props.handleRankChange(this.props.index, 1);}}>&#9650;</li>
	{this.props.postData.rank > 0 ?
	<li className="upvote">{this.props.postData.rank}
	</li>
	:<li className="downvote">{this.props.postData.rank}
	</li>}
	<li className="downvote" onClick={() => {this.props.handleRankChange(this.props.index, -1);}}>&#9660;</li>
</ul>
```

## Improvements

One improvement we would like to make is to have a login page for moderators. Users could then make requests to have trends removed, but moderators would be the only ones with permission to actually remove the trends. This would allow the ability to remove inappropriate submissions, but also protect the data from being deleted by anyone who decides they want to remove it.
