```JavaScript
mapHandler = (event) => {

	let location = event.target.dataset.name
	console.log(location);
	fetch(`/api/posts/${location}`, {
		method: 'GET',
		headers: {
			'Accept': 'application/json, text/plain, */*',
			'Content-Type': 'application/json'
		}
	})
	.then(data => data.json())
	.then(jData => {
		this.setState({ posts: [jData] })
		
	})

};

```

```JavaScript
  handleRankChange = (index, delta) => {
	  this.setState( prevState => {
		  // new array - copy of previous posts array
		  const updatedPosts = [ ...prevState.posts ];
		  // a copy of the post we are targeting
		  const updatedPost = updatedPosts[index];

		  // Update the target post's rank
		  updatedPost.rank += delta;

		  // Update the posts array with the target post's new rank
		  updatedPosts[index] = updatedPost;

		  this.handleUpdate(updatedPost);

		  return {
			  posts: updatedPosts

		  }
	  })
  }

```

## Improvements

One improvement we would like to make is to have a login page for moderators. Users could then make requests to have trends removed, but moderators would be the only ones with permission to actually remove the trends. This would allow the ability to remove inappropriate submissions, but also protect the data from being deleted by anyone who decides they want to remove it.
